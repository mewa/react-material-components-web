# React Material Components

This project aims to create a React library that exposes an interface to [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) implementation.

All components will be implemented using proper Foundation classes, where applicable, to ensure maximum compatibility with Material Design specifications. 

# Roadmap

The goal is to deliver a 100% compatible Material Design React implementation. 
Each release is going to include new components until full coverage is achieved.

The next milestone is [v0.1](https://github.com/mewa/react-material-components-web/milestone/1)

Currently implemented components:

- [x] Button
- [x] Card
- [ ] Elevation
- [ ] Floating Action Button
- [ ] Textfield
- [ ] Toolbar
